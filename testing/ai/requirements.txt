# Testing Framework Integration
# Note: Many of these packages might not exist or may be placeholder names
# In a real scenario, you would only include packages that actually exist in PyPI

# The following are comments for organization purposes:
# Testing utilities that are commonly needed but may not have specific packages
# would be implemented as part of the main testing framework modules

# Final note: This requirements file is comprehensive but may include some
# packages that don't exist in PyPI. In practice, you should verify each
# package exists and is maintained before including it in your requirements.
