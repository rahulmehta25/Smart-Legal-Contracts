## Performance Optimization

### Image Processing
- Native modules handle heavy OCR operations
- Images are compressed and cached locally
- Background processing prevents UI blocking

### Memory Management
- Automatic image cleanup after processing
- SQLite query optimization
- Lazy loading for document lists

### Battery Optimization
- Efficient camera usage with auto-pause
- Background sync throttling
- Smart notification scheduling

## Security

### Data Protection
- All documents processed locally by default
- Optional encrypted cloud backup
- Automatic data expiration for security

### Authentication
- Biometric authentication for app access
- Secure keychain storage for credentials
- Session timeout and auto-lock

### Privacy
- No tracking or analytics by default
- User consent for data sharing
- GDPR and CCPA compliance ready

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**OCR not working on Android:**
- Ensure Google Play Services is updated
- Check device compatibility with ML Kit

**iOS build fails:**
- Clean build folder: `rm -rf ios/build`
- Reinstall pods: `cd ios && pod install`
- Update Xcode and command line tools

**Camera permissions denied:**
- Check app permissions in device settings
- Restart app after granting permissions

**Performance issues:**
- Close other camera apps
- Free up device storage
- Update to latest app version
