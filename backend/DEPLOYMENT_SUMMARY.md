## 🚀 Quick Deploy to Railway

### 1. Go to Railway Dashboard
Visit: https://railway.app

### 2. Create New Project
- Click "New Project"
- Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
- Choose: `rahulmehta25/Smart-Legal-Contracts`
- Select branch: `deployment/railway-backend`
- Root directory: `/backend`

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Set these in Railway dashboard:
```env
ENVIRONMENT=production
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secure-64-character-secret-key-here-change-this
DATABASE_URL=(will be auto-set when you add PostgreSQL)
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
DEVICE=cpu
BATCH_SIZE=16
```

### 4. Add PostgreSQL Database
- Click "New Service" → "Database" → "Add PostgreSQL"
- Railway will automatically set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### 5. Deploy
- Railway will automatically build and deploy your application
- Build process will install dependencies from `requirements-production.txt`
- Health check will verify deployment at `/health` endpoint

## 🌐 Expected Deployment URL

Your backend will be deployed at:
`https://[your-project-name].up.railway.app`

## 🔍 Verification Endpoints

Once deployed, verify these endpoints work:

- **Health Check**: `GET /health`
- **API Documentation**: `GET /docs`
- **Root Info**: `GET /`
- **API Overview**: `GET /api/v1`

## 🔧 Production Optimizations Applied

- **Security**: CORS configured for production domains only
- **Performance**: CPU-only PyTorch, optimized batch size
- **Reliability**: Health checks, auto-restart on failure  
- **Scalability**: Multi-stage Docker build, minimal image size
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging, error handling

## 🔗 Frontend Integration

Once your backend is deployed:

1. Note the deployment URL: `https://[your-project-name].up.railway.app`
2. Update your frontend environment variables:
   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://[your-project-name].up.railway.app
   ```
3. Your frontend at `smart-legal-contracts.vercel.app` will automatically connect

## 📊 Expected Performance

- **Cold Start**: ~30-60 seconds (ML model loading)
- **Health Check**: <200ms after warm-up  
- **API Response**: <500ms for most endpoints
- **Memory Usage**: ~512MB-1GB (depending on models)

## 🎯 Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Verify Health**: Check `/health` endpoint returns 200
2. **Test API**: Use `/docs` to test core endpoints  
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check Railway deployment logs for errors
4. **Update Frontend**: Point your frontend to the new backend URL
5. **Performance Test**: Run load tests if needed

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Build Timeout**: PyTorch installation may take 5-10 minutes
- **Memory Limit**: Increase Railway plan if needed for ML models
- **Cold Starts**: First request may be slow due to model loading
