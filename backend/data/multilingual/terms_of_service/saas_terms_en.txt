9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CLOUDTECH SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.

10. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.

Any legal dispute between you and CloudTech arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.

The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will take place in the county where you reside or another mutually agreed location. You and CloudTech agree that the arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.

CLASS ACTION WAIVER: You and CloudTech agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Unless both you and CloudTech agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

JURY TRIAL WAIVER: You and CloudTech waive any constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury. You and CloudTech are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.

OPT-OUT: You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of first accepting these Terms by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to legal@cloudtech.com with the subject line "Arbitration Opt-out."

11. GOVERNING LAW
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

12. SEVERABILITY
If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

13. CHANGES TO TERMS
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify users of any material changes by posting the new Terms on our website and updating the "Last Updated" date.
