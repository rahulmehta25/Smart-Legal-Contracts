Before pursuing formal legal action, parties agree to attempt good-faith resolution of disputes through direct negotiation. Such negotiations should be conducted by authorized representatives with decision-making authority.

If informal negotiations fail to resolve a dispute within sixty (60) days, the parties may agree to pursue mediation through a mutually acceptable mediator or mediation service.

For disputes that cannot be resolved through negotiation or mediation, the parties agree that all claims, disputes, or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be conducted in the city where DigitalServe's principal place of business is located, unless the parties agree to a different location. Each party shall bear its own costs and attorneys' fees, except that the arbitrator may award costs and fees to the prevailing party if permitted by applicable law. The arbitration award shall be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and shall be binding upon the parties' successors and assigns.

25. CLASS ACTION AND REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING WAIVER
YOU AND DIGITALSERVE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

In the event that the arbitration provision is deemed unenforceable, both parties waive their right to trial by jury and agree that any court proceedings shall be conducted before a judge sitting without a jury.
