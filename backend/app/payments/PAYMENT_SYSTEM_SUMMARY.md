## Implementation Examples

### 1. Payment Processing

```python
from app.payments.stripe import StripePaymentProcessor

# Initialize processor
stripe_processor = StripePaymentProcessor(
    api_key="sk_live_...",
    webhook_secret="whsec_..."
)

# Create payment
payment = await stripe_processor.create_payment_intent(
    amount=99.00,
    currency="usd",
    customer_id="cus_...",
    metadata={"subscription_id": "123"}
)
```

### 2. Subscription Management

```python
from app.payments.billing_cycles import BillingCycleManager

billing_manager = BillingCycleManager(db)

# Process billing cycles
result = await billing_manager.process_billing_cycles()
print(f"Processed {result['processed']} subscriptions")
```

### 3. Usage Tracking
