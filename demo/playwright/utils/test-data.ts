TERMS AND CONDITIONS

DISPUTE RESOLUTION
For disputes under $1,000, either party may choose to resolve the matter through binding arbitration or small claims court. For disputes over $1,000, the parties agree to first attempt mediation through a neutral third party. If mediation is unsuccessful, the matter may proceed to arbitration at the option of either party, or may be resolved through the courts.

Certain types of disputes, including but not limited to intellectual property claims and injunctive relief, are excluded from the arbitration requirement and may be brought in court.

The arbitration procedures, if chosen, shall follow the rules of the National Arbitration Forum, unless both parties agree to alternative procedures.
