6.1 Mandatory Binding Arbitration

You and TechCorp agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, or your use of the Service (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court if the claim qualifies for small claims court and remains in such court.

6.2 Arbitration Rules and Procedures

The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules) then in effect, except as modified by this Section 6. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. You may obtain forms and instructions for initiating arbitration by contacting the AAA.

6.3 Arbitration Location and Procedure

Unless you and TechCorp otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and TechCorp submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.

6.4 Class Action Waiver

YOU AND TECHCORP AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and TechCorp agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

6.5 Jury Trial Waiver

YOU AND TECHCORP HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and TechCorp are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Agreement. This waiver applies to any and all claims, whether based on contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory.

6.6 Arbitration Fees

TechCorp will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the AAA Consumer Rules where your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000. If your claim for damages exceeds $75,000 or if you seek non-monetary relief, the payment of AAA fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
